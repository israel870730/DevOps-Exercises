# DevOps-Exercises
My DevOps Exercises 

These are some of the tools with which I have worked every day throughout my professional career.
My idea is to centralize in a single repo many of the practical exercises that I have done to feel good with these tools or even some that I have had to do for the companies I have worked for,

I hope it can also be helpful to other people.
